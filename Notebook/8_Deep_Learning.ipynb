        "In this section, I'm going to try two neural networks coded by Frank. The first is [Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM)](https://wiki.pathmind.com/restricted-boltzmann-machine) and the second [Autoencoders for Recommendations (AutoRec)](https://medium.com/@connectwithghosh/recommender-system-on-the-movielens-using-an-autoencoder-using-tensorflow-in-python-f13d3e8d600d). Although I am pretty impressed and satisfied with my SVD results, Frank argues that there are good reasons for building recommenders with Deep Learning techniques. One is that it lets us take advantage of all the rapid advances in the fields of AI and deep learning. Neural networks (deep learning) have the potential to find complex patterns that more traditional machine learning techniques may miss. Second, we can handle larger datasets, especially when using TensorFlow along clusters of GPUs.\n",
