        "A good hybrid recommender won't just average out the performance of each one. It will leverage the strengths of some recommenders to augment the weaknesses of others, and leave you with a system that's more than just the sum of its parts. Developing recommender systems sometimes feels like more of an art than a science, and choosing how to combine different algorithms can feel like choosing different colors in a painting that complement each other.
