        "1. Intro to content-based recommendations\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "So far we have looked at making recommendations based solely on how the entire population feels about items. While these recommendations can be useful, they aren't personalized.\r\n",
        "2. What are content-based recommendations?\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "In this chapter, we will move to more targeted models by recommending items based on their similarities to items a user has liked in the past. For example, if a user likes book A, and we calculate that book A and book B are similar, we believe the user will like book B. We will address how to calculate what items are similar and which ones are not. We can do so by comparing the attributes of our items. The recommendations made by finding items with similar attributes are called content-based recommendations.\r\n",
        "3. Items' attributes or characteristics\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "For example, if we were looking at a dataset describing books, the attributes could be the author of the book, its publishing date, its length, or its genre, really any descriptive information. A big advantage of using an item's attributes over user feedback is that you can make recommendations for any items you have attribute data on. This includes even brand new items that users have not seen yet. Content-based models require us to use any available attributes to build profiles of items in a way that allows us to mathematically compare between them. This allows us for example to find the most similar items and recommend them.\r\n",
        "4. Vectorizing your attributes\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "This is best done by encoding each item as a vector. Here we can see an example with a vector for each item stored as a row and each feature as a column. Why this shape you might ask? It is extremely valuable to have your data in this format so the distance and similarities between items can be easily calculated, which is vital for generating recommendations. We'll discuss how to calculate distances and similarities between vectors later in the course. First, we will cover how to convert the most common data format for attributes to this shape. We will continue using the book dataset from chapter 1, but this time we introduce an additional book_genre table.\r\n",
        "5. One to many relationships\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "This book_genre table, as seen here on the left, contains a one to many reference of books to their genres. This type of one to many lookup is very common in relational databases. Remember from this table, we want to create a new table that contains a single row per item, encoding whether or not it has that attribute like you see here on the right.\r\n",
        "6. Crosstabulation\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "To transform this data we can use pandas' crosstab function. The crosstab function generates the cross-tabulation of two (or more) factors, and here we want to use it to find the cross-tabulation of the book titles and the genres they have been labeled with.\r\n",
        "7. Crosstabulation\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "We call pd-dot-crosstab, passing in the book titles as the first argument, and the book genres as the second argument. The first argument will become the rows, and the second becomes the columns. Here we can see the desired result.\r\n",
        "8. Let's practice!\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Great, now we have our data in a format that will allow us to calculate similarities and make recommendations. Time to try these data transformations yourself. "

This returns 0-point-75, a reasonable score, as they are both fun action-packed fantasy books. If we perform a similar comparison between The Hobbit and The Great Gatsby, we get a much lower score of point-one-five.

The ascending argument must be set to False to show the highest ranked books first. Unsurprisingly, all the top recommendations are similar fantasy adventure books!\r\n",

For example, if you were comparing the script of this course against the scripts of all the courses on DataCamp, the term \"DataFrame\" might get a low score as although it occurs a lot, it is present in many DataCamp courses.

        "\r\n",
        "In this chapter, you have learned how to use items' attributes to generate content-based recommendations by finding items that are similar to each other.\r\n",
        "2. Item to item recommendations\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "This has many uses such as suggesting obscure books that are similar to your favorite, proposing the next movie to watch that is like the one you just finished, or even finding alternative options when items are out of stock.\r\n",
        "3. User profiles\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "But people are not so one dimensional that they only like one item. They may have read many different books and want to find one that is aligned with their wide array of tastes. For example, taking a look at tfidf_summary_df that we have used previously, we have a row per book, with a column for each of the possible genres it could fall under. For user-based recommendations, we need vectors to represent individual items as well as vectors to represent a user's likes. This will allow us to compare a user's likes to various items to see which items might suit them best.\r\n",
        "4. Extract the user data\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Let's take an example of a user that has read a set of books. The most straightforward way of creating a user profile is to first get the vectors corresponding with the books they have read, by slicing tfidf_summary_df containing all the books, as you see here using the reindex method. Remember tfidf_summary_df contains TF-IDF features for all books in our data set. This creates a DataFrame containing rows only for books the user has read and their TF-IDF scores. This still has multiple rows and we want a single vector for our user. To go from the full table to a summary of the users tastes we can simply find the average of each column, representing the average of the characteristics of the books the user liked.\r\n",
        "5. Build the user profile\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "We find the average of each column by calling dot mean on the DataFrame. The average values in this Series represent the user profile or in other words a way of representing all of the user's preferences at once. For example, this user appears to enjoy books that have high values in the \"ancient\" TF-IDF feature. This implies that the word \"ancient\" is prominent in books they like. This profile can, with a bit of reshaping, be used as a vector to compare against other books.\r\n",
        "6. Finding recommendations for a user\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "This user profile can then be used to find the most similar books that they have not yet read. We first must find the subset of books that have not been read by dropping those contained in the watched list (specifying the index axis by setting axis to 0). We then calculate the cosine similarity matrix as we did in the previous lesson, but this time between the User profile vector you just created and the DataFrame of all the books the user has not read yet. Then we wrap the output in a DataFrame and sort the results once again so we can access and order the data easily.\r\n",
        "7. Getting the top recommendations\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "After sorting the recommendation scores you will now be able to recommend items based on a user's full history, not just based on individual items. These top values are the items that are the most similar to the interests of the user based on their full background of interests, making them good suggestions for the user to read next.\r\n",
        "8. Let's practice!\r\n",
