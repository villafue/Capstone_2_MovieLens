        "Why Recommendation Systems? They're everywhere. Whether it's Netflix, Amazon, or Spotify what we experience digitally is the culmination of many algorithms analyzing factors such as our demographics, interests, and even how much time we spend on a page. If you pay attention, it's hard not to run into a recommendation system online.\n",
        "\n",
        "I also love that it's both a scientific and psychological challenge. There are many metrics data scientists use to measure the efficacy of a recommender system, yet none of it matters if your target audience doesn't like the content that's displayed to them. \n",
        "\n",
        "This conundrum is part of why I loved Frank's recommendation course. He not only taught the different types of popular recommendation algorithms, but also balanced it against real-world problems and issues. It opened my eyes from just optimizing metrics to taking a holistic view of my recommendation system brings value to both the employer and the customer.\n",
        "\n",
        "As mentioned in the **[Preface](#preface)**, my recommender systems are built around Frank's framework in his recommendation system course. He uses the small [Movie Lens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/) dataset which consist of 100k ratings for movies. More will be explained in the EDA section of this notebook. \n",
