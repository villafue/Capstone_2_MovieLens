        "Why Recommendation Systems? They're everywhere. Whether it's Netflix, Amazon, or Spotify what we experience digitally is the culmination of many algorithms analyzing factors such as users' demographics, interests, and even how much time they spend on a page. If one pays attention, it's hard not to run into a recommendation system online.\n",
        "\n",
        "I also love that it's both a scientific and psychological challenge. There are many metrics data scientists use to measure the efficacy of a recommender system, yet none of it matters if the target audience doesn't like the content that's displayed to them. \n",
        "\n",
        "This conundrum is part of why I loved Frank's recommendation course. He not only taught the different types of popular recommendation algorithms, but also balanced it against real-world problems and issues. It opened my eyes from just optimizing metrics to taking a holistic view of how my recommendation system brings value to both the employer and the customer.\n",
        "\n",
        "As mentioned in the **[Preface](#preface)**, my recommender systems are built around Frank's framework in his recommendation system course. He uses the small [Movie Lens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/) dataset which consist of 100k ratings for movies. More will be explained in the EDA section of this notebook. \n",

        "Frank's recommendation architecture includes 5 classes. Some of the functions are imported from [Surpriselib](https://surprise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) and some are written from scratch, but all are interdependent to make building and testing a recommendation system easier. `RecommenderMetrics.py` holds all the functions of metrics used to assess our models. `MovieLens.py` loads up the raw MovieLens files and converts them into datasets our models can use. `EvaluatedAlgorithm.py` is the class that applies all the metrics to a given algorithm, and `EvaluationData.py` is what pre-processes the data for training and testing in our models. Last, the `Evaluator` class allows us to quickly add algorithms to train and compare with each other at the same time. When used all together, this framework makes learning and building recommendation systems easier and fun!  "

I would use my `ContentKNN` algorithm to recommend popular movies, my `Hybrid - 9.4.07` algorithm for recommendations based upon my interests and watch history, and I would definitely include the `Random` algorithm to give users the opportunity to explore movies the other two algorithms would otherwise overlook. \n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "1.   Frank said one of the biggest issues was data sparsity, and admitted that 100k ratings is not enough information. Because of this, some models did not perform as well or as optimal as possible. One avenue I would like to take is to use the full 27 million rating dataset from [GroupLens.org](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/). \n",
        "2.   Exploring the full 27 million dataset would probably require me to use a platform like Apache Spark to spread all the data among clusters. Using this platform would be a worthy endeavor in and of itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. The MovieLens dataset has a links.csv which contain movie identifiers for movie databases such as IMDB. By using the identifiers, I can download matching information, for a movie, such as directors, actors, synopses, etc. These added features would allow higher avenues of exploration.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. I did not use any sort of [TF-IDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf) algorithms as there were no summaries, movie reviews, or synopses to analyze for a recommender system. If I had that information, I could use those as part of an algorithm.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Other areas of improvement stems from technical issues. I could only use RandomizedSearchCV with one of my algorithms. With the exception of SVD, I'm not confident in my hyperparameter tuning as it took all day to run and I could only use GridSearchCV. Also, Frank admitted the Hybrid algorithm was rather simple. I had to input the weights of each algorithm and that was how my Hybrid recommender was created. I would like to one day partner with a programmer or do it myself where the weights are learned for each Hybrid model.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Instead of an algorithm recommending top ten movies, I would like to customize it by maybe having it only recommend the top eight or nine movies instead. The last two slots could be reserved with random movies or popular movies. Furthermore, Frank's framework did not allow an algorithm to recommend a movie a user has already seen. This meant that favorite movies such as Avengers or Star Wars would never be recommended again. I think allowing a recommendation of at least one watched movie would establish user trust in the recommender system, which could give the user peace-of-mind that the recommendations are relevant for him or her.\n",
