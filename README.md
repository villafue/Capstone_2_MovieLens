# Building Recommender Systems with Machine Learning and AI

*Recommendation systems are everywhere, and in today's digital world, it's hard not to be apart of a system's algorithm. Whether it's my purchases on Amazon, what I watch on Youtube, or even my personal playlists on Spotify, my information is used to influence what I (and others) consume next. In fact, in this June, 2020 [article](https://medium.com/swlh/we-know-what-you-like-perks-of-recommendation-systems-in-business-5f227bb6d09) by Miquido, they say that 35% of Amazon's revenue comes from recommendations and 75% of what users watch comes from movie recommendations. Furthermore, the Netflix recommendation system saves them over $1 billion each year! This is not an insignificant amount. It makes sense why businesses incorporate recommender systems as part of their business model.*

*Unfortunately, most personal projects building recommenders evaluate the efficacy of their system using only an accuracy metric such as the [RMSE](https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/regression-analysis/rmse-root-mean-square-error/), and in the real world, people couldn't care less if an algorithm can accurately predict how many stars they would give a movie. All they care about is if they'll love the content that's shown them. This is why I chose to build my recommender systems using [Frank Kane's](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fkane/?trk=lil_course) core framework from his [Building Recommender Systems with Machine Learning and AI](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/building-recommender-systems-with-machine-learning-and-ai/install-anaconda-review-course-materials-and-create-movie-recommendations?u=36492188) course.*  



# Capstone_2_MovieLens
Springboard: Recommendation System

Update: 

7March2021 - I had to switch from Netflix to MovieLens as the Netflix dataset did not have user information or ratings of any kind.
